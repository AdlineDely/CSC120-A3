Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I forgot their name but it's one of my classmate ! They usally sits in the back same row as me. 
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
None. I was thinking of going to TA but I was told it wasn't as helpful so instead I did some searching of my own and use oracle docs. 
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
Java is entire different beast but like python, I just need to give it a chance. I know eventually I'll get faster at completing these assignments and it will make more sense as well! For now, it feels like it make sense but sometimes feels like it's just magic. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
One main difference, base on what I know, is that you have protection in java than python. You can have something be turn into private. Python, on the other hand, is a lot easier to learn and the components of a coding line is a lot fewers. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Starting early was very helpful, taking some class time to talk about it was very helpful ! One thing that I struggle with is getting myself unstuck.
